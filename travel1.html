            <h2>Day 1: Windermere and Penrith</h2>
          

            <div class="content">
                <p>I currently live in Coventry, so I had to take a train to Penrith. There was some layover at Manchester (the place where the first Industrial Revolution happened, have to use those school history lessons I had somewhere😏) as well. It was my first time in Manchester, and it was October 31st, i.e., Halloween. The streets were so busy, filled with people until 5 AM. It was also fascinating to see how everyone was dressed. There was chaos everywhere. I did get some cookies and chips to eat from Sainsbury's, and then later went to Archie's to try their waffle, which was very, very sweet for me. I felt like I was sugar-bombed, lol. Manchester's streets looked good, but we didn't explore it a lot. Most of the time we stayed within the railway station.</p>

                <p>The first place that we reached was Penrith. It was quite a small town. Older people were jogging in the morning; it was beautiful to see how healthy people were. I was quite sleepy by the time we arrived in Penrith and badly wanted to sleep since I didn't sleep in Manchester due to the almost 5+ hour layover. Then we went to Penrith Castle, which was quite close to Penrith railway station. It wasn't like a typical full, huge castle but in fact the remains of it. It was apparently built by English people to defend against the Scots.</p>
                <div class="photo-grid">
                    <div class="photo-placeholder"><img src="ld/20251101_065211.jpg" alt="Buttermere landscape 1"></img></div>
                    <div class="photo-placeholder"><img src="ld/PXL_20251101_064639618.jpg" alt="Buttermere landscape 1"></img></div>
                </div>

                
                <p>Since the castle wasn't that large, we wrapped our visit in 20 mins. Then went to McDonald's which was again close to the Penrith Railway station. There is no chicken available haha, so opted to have some hot chocolate. It was way too hot that I burnt my tongue and the effect was there for a week, so never drink your hot chocolate when it's too hot haha. This was our breakfast for the day. Then we headed to the bus station, which is again closer to the railway station. We checked routes using a map poster stuck at the bus station and we decided to go to explore Windermere first and then planned to head back to Keswick where our hotel was. Then for day 2 we planned not much. We don't pre-plan trips lol, we randomly explore places. I have to add this here, people were so nice, for example one of the bus drivers made sure we were waiting for the right bus and another lady was nice and spoke to us for a while and was telling how Lake District is her retirement home etc. Then it was our time to get the bus.</p>

                <p>We reached Windermere after a 1 hour bus journey. We really didn't know where to go, lol. We were so excited about the place that we skipped our lunch and were exploring. We then happened to come across the "The Lake District Holocaust Project Museum" and went in. Around 300 Jewish children and teenagers, Holocaust survivors, were brought here to Windermere by plane in August 1945 to start their lives from ground zero. There is also a movie based on this called "The Windermere Children". A  lot of these kids turned out to be successful and also managed to learn English. Quite interesting how really young people were so determined :).</p>
                <div class="photo-placeholder"><img src="ld/20251101_111059.jpg" alt="Buttermere landscape 1"></img></div>



                <p>Then we came across this open bus 555 which goes around various places. We jumped in and went to the top. It was my first time on an open bus, I enjoyed it a lot. Then we got down and came across a graveyard before reaching Windermere lake, which was filled filled with swans, seagulls, Canadian geese, ducks, and a crow-looking bird, not sure what it is. Took some snaps of these, and we realized there was a cruise + steam engine package offered at Windermere Lake Cruise near the lake. We paid around 28 GBP per head for it and got into the cruise, which was literally about to leave in a few seconds.</p>

                </div>

                    
                    
                    
                    <p> The cruise ride was amazing. In the background, a guy kept telling the history of the place as well. One thing that still stands out to me is a lonely lady who lived in a large mansion near the lake, she never spoke with anyone :/. It was a 40-minute cruise ride. I was never bored, was just enjoying the wind and the ride.</p>
                     <div class="photo-grid">

                </div>

                <p>Then we came to the place where we had to take a short steam engine ride, which was quite beautiful. It was my first time seeing a steam engine train, and the guy was talking non-stop, a very energetic guy who was part of the crew. Then we stopped near an eating place where they sold a huge slice of pizza for 1 GBP. I'm not a big pizza fan, but this tasted too good, ngl.</p>
                <div class="photo-grid">
                    <div class="photo-placeholder"><img src="ld/20251101_133044.jpg" alt="Buttermere landscape 1"></img></div>

                </div>

                <p>Then we just returned via the steam engine and the cruise. Then we headed back to Keswick and reached back around 7 PM. We checked into Premier Inn and headed to the place where we came in. So reservation is a thing in Keswick, so make sure you reserve a seat at any place before you eat. We ended up going to Saffron Kitchen, the waiter there was selling off his papadom, lol. It was really good too. But of course, yeah, it's just a papadom. The gravy we had was very good, the naan was too huge though.</p>

            <h2>Day 2: Keswick and Buttermere (or HeavenHERE?)</h2>

          

            <div class="content">
                <p>Then we headed back and slept. In the morning, we had breakfast at Premier Inn—a full English breakfast. This was my first time having hash browns, I really liked them. Then we came across the fact that there's a pencil factory in Keswick. Apparently, the pencil was discovered in Borrowdale Valley which is located near Keswick!!!!!!!!! I never expected it. So as soon as we entered, we were asked if we wanted to take part in a quiz. What this is, is that we were offered a question paper and we had to answer all the questions, if we did, we'd get a prize. I did take it very seriously and started hunting for answers, and so you should have guessed it, I read everything, xd. So some fun facts:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Graphite was more expensive than gold.</li>
                    <li>So how graphite was discovered is that there was a large storm and it uprooted a large tree, under that was a black substance which was then thought to be charcoal, but when burnt, nothing happened to it and it just left a mark and was used by people to mark sheep, and this eventually led to the discovery of pencils.</li>
                    <li>Pencils played a huge role in World War II. Now you might think how? So apparently there's a guy named Charles Fraser Smith who got this idea to hide compasses and maps within pencils. These special pencils were made at the Cumberland Pencil Factory for the soldiers, so even if a soldier got caught, the map containing escape points and infiltration points didn't get compromised.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="photo-grid">
                    <div class="photo-placeholder"><img src="ld/20251102_105509.jpg" alt="Buttermere landscape 1"></img></div>
                    <div class="photo-placeholder"><img src="ld/20251102_102036.jpg" alt="Buttermere landscape 1"></img></div>
                </div>

                

                <p>I managed to answer all questions, and when I went to the museum counter to hand over my answers, the girl told me there are questions on the back too. I swear I didn't see it as the paper was pinned to a paper pad. Then I just tried to search for answers for these too and found them. Apparently one of my answers was wrong, but I was still given a prize (paint pen).</p>

                <p>Then we went to Keswick city centre, it was so happening, people were everywhere and there were a lot of winter stuff shops. Then we headed to the Keswick park alongside a beautiful lake. Another thing I noticed: almost everyone had a dog companion. Then there was a cool bird-watching place as well. Then I just routed towards the posh area, and then we happened to stumble upon a bus heading to Buttermere. At this point, you might be like, wait what, how random can I be, but yeah, I am, haha. We just got in.</p>

      

                <p>The best part of the trip was Buttermere and the journey to Buttermere. Such a stunning place, I swear. I have no words to explain how beautiful it was, so I'll drop some pictures here.</p>
<div class="photo-placeholder"><img src="ld/PXL_20251102_134535448.LONG_EXPOSURE-01.jpg" alt="Buttermere landscape 1"></img></div>
          

                
                    <p>Finally the most beautiful bus journey came to an end. We reached the last stop and got down from the bus. Then we headed towards Buttermere lake which was about 10 mins away. While walking there, we came across a lot of sheeps. It was my first time seeing sheep, they kept running away when I went closer, I we quit doing it 🫩 and continued towards the lake.</p>
                 <div class="photo-grid">
                    <div class="photo-placeholder"><img src="ld/PXL_20251102_143039892.jpg" alt="Buttermere landscape 1"></img></div>
                    <div class="photo-placeholder"><img src="ld/PXL_20251102_142917646.jpg" alt="Buttermere landscape 1"></img></div>
                </div>

                    <p>We reached Buttermere lake quite quickly. From here, we headed towards Falls Scale Force waterfalls.</p>
                  <div class="photo-placeholder"><img src="ld/PXL_20251102_150518713.MP.jpg" alt="Buttermere landscape 1"></img></div>

                Then, we had to climb towards a peak. we climbed for almost 1 hour and reached the beautiful falls Scale Force, the highest waterfall in the Lake District. Truly breathtaking. Then we had to climb down the hill since our last bus was within a few hours, so we headed back to the bus station (We didn't reach the highest point of the Waterfalls due to this). Going down was quite tiring, and we were relatively slow, xd.</p>
                  <div class="photo-placeholder"><img src="ld/PXL_20251102_151032594.MP.jpg" alt="Buttermere landscape 1"></img></div>




                                     




                <p>Then we reached the station. We almost ran in the middle, thinking we might miss the last bus, but we reached 20 minutes early and started to wait. A very nice lady suddenly came to us and asked if we needed a lift and if we were waiting for a bus for too long. We said no and told her the bus would be there in a few minutes. She just left after that. I should say this: people are understanding here, and it felt like utopia, haha.</p>

                <p>Then we headed back to Keswick. We went to have our dunch at Piri Fresco, which was about a 5-minute walk from Keswick station. I have to say this, the corn cob was way too good there, a must-try. I loved their pasta and burger too.</p>

                <p>Then after having a really good meal, we had to bid our bye to Keswick and head back to Penrith, the place where we started. While we were waiting for the bus, we had a moon photography war.</p>

                 <div class="photo-grid">

                </div>

               

                <p>Then we headed to Penrith, and from there got a direct train to Coventry, no layover, luckily.</p>

                <p>This was a trip I badly wanted to do after I passed CDSA from HackTheBox or at least after getting a job, but I never had the time. Finally did it 🥺.</p>

            <h2>More Dtails on the Trip </h2>
          

            <div class="content">
                <p>Well reader, you've reached the last section of the blog. I just wanted to maintain my unpredictable choices that I made during the trip, and hence have kept this section at the end 🙃.</p>

                <p>The following is a picture of the map with the route I followed during the trip. First, I reached Penrith, then went to Windermere, and then to Keswick on day 1. On day 2, I went from Keswick to Buttermere.</p>
                                  <div class="photo-placeholder"><img src="ld/2025-12-09 20_48_32-@Killswitch2 - Discord.png" alt="Buttermere landscape 1"></img></div>

                                                      <div class="photo-placeholder"><img src="ld/20251209_214923.jpg" alt="Buttermere landscape 1"></img></div>

             <p>I know that the thing I drew is so bad, xd. A small tip here btw: since we had to take a lot of buses on the day 1 of the trip, we took the Stagecoach day pass which is around 12 GBP, and this allows you to take unlimited buses for the particular day. For the second day, we paid for the individual trips, and it costs around 3 GBP per trip on Stagecoach. And yes, you can travel everywhere around the Lake District with Stagecoach, but note that they don't go to certain places during the winter (for example, they don't go to Buttermere). Another butterfly effect 🦋 for me was that the day we went was the last day before winter started and buses don't go to Buttermere anymore. We were lucky since Buttermere was the best part of the trip for me. The trip cost 210 GBP overall, most of it went to accommodation and food. Well, this is it, I'll wrap up the blog here. Stay tuned for more adventures!</p>
