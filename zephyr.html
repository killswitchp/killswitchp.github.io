    1. Introduction:  
</p>
<p>
Firstly,a very special thanks to<span style="color:firebrick;text-shadow: 0 0 5px firebrick;"> Brainspill3r</span> for the 1 year Pro Labs subscription. I was so out of touch with red teaming as I was into blue teaming for past few months. I and <span style="color: #8affff;text-shadow: 0 0 5px  #8affff;"> HolyWater 🌊</span> decided to do the Pro labs during the Christmas<span style="color:green;text-shadow: 0 0 5px green;">🎄</span> vaccation and we completed it. Doing this<span style="color:#4aa470;text-shadow: 0 0 5px #4aa470;"> Zephyr Pro labs</span> brought me back to track and I enjoyed it a lot. I thought I could crack it in a week or so but it took more time. Solving Zephyr taught me a lot of new concepts, making it a great learning experience.

    2. About the Lab:🧑‍💻
    <p>We are tasked to conduct a internal penetration test on a corporate network. There are totally 17 machines and 17 flags which we have to obtain. Initially I thought Zephyr was purely AD (Active Directory) but it indeed had some web portion as well.

    <p>I'm PNPT certified and hence I already knew the basic AD attacks but while doing zephyr I had to learn some a lot of new AD attacks.</p>

   4. My tips for the Lab: 😉 
</p>
<p>- This lab requires a lot of pivoting and ligolo-ng and comes in so handy in these siutations. I myself never used ligolo-ng previously before this lab but now after using it I highly recommend it for pivoting.</p>
<p>- There are multiple points where you have to learn a totally new concept so get ready to read like 10 blogs and try around 3+ tools for it.</p>
<p>- Sometimes the lab gets broken and its mainly because a lot of people are connected to it so if its broken try to switch your VPN server and try a different VPN server.</p>
<p>- Learning some concepts like delgation, cross domain trust exploitation and active directory certificate services before taking the labs can help you a lot but not mandatory. (I learnt it while doing the labs)</p>
<p>- A good understanding of various user integrity levels also is highly required.</p>
<p>- Knowledge of some basic AMSI bypass or AV bypass technique comes in handy. </p>
<p>- Tools like evil-winrm, xfreerdp , crackmapexec/netexec and psexec really help you a lot. If some tool doesn't run in a winrm session, try it in a rdp session.</p>
<p>- Also learn to enable RDP or SMB service using windows command prompt/powershell commands (you can generate these commands using chatGPT).</p>
<p>- Use tools like bloodhound and ldapdomaindump to enumerate the domain to the fullest. These both tools will help you a lot in this lab. </p>
